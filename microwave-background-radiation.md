## What is Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation?

Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) is thought to be the left-over radiation from the Big Bang. CMBR cannot be seen with the human eye but it is everywhere in the Universe. It is invisible to humans because it is so cold, just 2.725 degrees above what is known as absolute zero (-2725 degrees). This means its radiation is most visible in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence the name Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. The temperature of deep space has been measured as around 3 Kelvin, not absolute zero, due to the remaining energy from the Big Bang (CMBR).
