## The Mixture of Elements

During the Big Bang, only the lightest elements were formed â€“ hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium and beryllium. As the clouds of cosmic fust and gases from the Big Bang cooled, stars formed and there then grouped together to form galaxies. The Big Bang theory predicts how much of each element should have been made in the early universe, and what we see in very distant galaxies and old stars is supports this idea.
