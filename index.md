## What is the Big Bang Theory?
The Big Bang Theory is the current leading explanation about the beginning of the universe. In summary, it states that the universe as we know it started with just a single, microscopic point, then over the next 13.7 billion years it expanded to the cosmos that we know today. Not only was The Big Bang Theory the birth of matter, but also space and time which makes it very hard to comprehend. 
The Big Bang is a theory scientist have constructed for how the universe seen around us came to be. The theory does not attempt to answer the most common question humans ask about the origin of the cosmos: why? This question likely cannot be answered since, as stated on earthsky.org, “whatever caused the appearance of that tiny point of energy, containing the seeds of everything that would ever be, was not of this universe”.

## What does the Big Bang Theory State?
At the earliest known period of the Universe (the Planck Epoch), all matter was condensed on a single point of infinite density and extreme heat. During this period, it is believed that the quantum effects of gravity dominated physical interactions and that no other forces had equal strength to gravitation.
This period of time extends from point 0 to approximately 10^-43 seconds. Due to the extreme heat and density of matter, the state of the universe was exceptionally unstable. It therefore began to expand and cool, leading to the creation of the fundamental forces of physics.


Although the Big Bang is just a theory, there is a significant amount of evidence pointing towards its truth. This evidence includes: the [redshift of galaxies](/redshift), [microwave background radiation](/microwave-background-radiation), and the [mixture of elements](/mixture-of-elements).

Although the Big Bang is the theory with the most evidence supporting it’s truth, there are many other theories that are believed and they can be found [here](/alternative-theories).
