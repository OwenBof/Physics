There are many alternative theories that contrast ideas to the Big Bang, this is as many scientists think the idea of a single colossal explosion of light is not how the universe began, part of this is because science is an evidence-based subject, meaning accepted theories always go where the evidence points â€“ some scientists do not believe that there is enough evidence to prove the truth of the Big Bang Theory and so believe in others such as the theories stated below. 

## The Steady State Model.

The Steady State Model denies the possibility of there being a beginning and end for the universe, instead opting for a continually expanding universe that maintains the same overall density. In this theory, galaxies, planets as well as all other forms of matter are in a cyclic process of continual recreation as old astronomical objects become unobservable, new creations take their place. 

This theory was initially proposed by Sir James Hopwood Jeans in 1928 and was further developed in the late-1940s by Fred Hoyle, Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi.

## The Bouncing Cosmological Model

The Bouncing Cosmology, Big Bounce, or Cyclic Universe model involves a fast, Big Bang - like expansion of the universe, however, it adds a rewind function, accounting not only for expansion, but also the contraction of the universe.

A cyclical universe shrinks to its smallest volume, and then "bounces" back into a subsequent expansion. Another variant proposes a cosmos that only bounced once. In this one, the present-day universe came into being after an earlier contraction. According to the single-bounce theory, the universe of today will expand forever.
This theory was first propounded by Juliano Cesar Silva Neves in a paper published in the journal General Relativity and Gravitation.

## The Plasma/Electric Universe Theory
